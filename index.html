        <p> Publications, from corporate memos to newsletters to electronic books to scholarly journal articles, must be considered first-class content on the Web, equal to the more common forms of Web pages available today. This document describes the various use cases highlighting the problems users and publishers face when these publications are to be used in a digital, Web environment. This document introduces Web Publications, a vision for the future of digital publishing that is based on a fully native representation of documents within the Open Web Platform. Web Publications achieve full convergence between online and offline/portable document publishing: publishers and users won't need to choose one or the other, but can switch between them dynamically, at will. Authors can concentrate on the way they intend to transmit their ideas and emotions, without having to deal with the specificities of a particular format.</p>

        <p>This document outlines a general vision and should not be considered a technical specification. Instead, its goal is to outline that vision and possible technical directions to achieve it, and reflects the discussions that occured in the Digital Publishing Interest Group. In partiucular, this document looks at some of the technical implications, and possible solutions, arising from the use cases and requirements collected by the Digital Publishing Interest Group, and documented in a companion UCR document&nbsp;[[pwp-ucr]]. Some of the sections are more detailed and more mature than others. A more detailed and rigoruous specification should be done by a separated, dedicated Working Group in the future; the final version of this document will published as an Interest Group Note.</p>

            <h3>The Vision of Publishing on the Web</h3>
            <section>
                <h4>The High Level Vision</h4>

                <p>The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within domains, with explicit navigation elements built into them, Web pages evolved into Web sites. This model however inherited very little from an existing, powerful and much older page-based media: books.</p>

                <p>Over centuries, โbooksโ have assumed many forms: journals, magazines, pamphlets of longform articles and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics, notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different manifestations as โpublicationsโ: bound editions of meaningful media, made public.</p>

                <p>We believe there is great value in combining this older traditionโof portable, bounded publicationsโwith the pervasive accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>. New models of economic sustainability, innovative experiences of knowledge and invigorated socio-cultural engagement depend on this.</p>

                <p>It is the task of the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> to explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing these two great models of publishing together. This document explores the technical feasibility and some of the challenges arising from real use cases that arise when exploring this vision further. Many of these challenges arise from the various use cases, documented in the separate note on PWP Use Cases and Requirement&nbsp;[[pwp-ucr]]</p>

                <h4>The Technical Vision</h4>

                <aside class="annotation">
                  This section should be rewritten to emphasize the difference between packaged and non-packaged
                </aside>

                <p>From a technical viewpoint, our vision for <a>Web Publications</a> is to define a class of documents on the Web that would be part of the Digital Publishing ecosystem but would also be fully native citizens of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>.  In this vision, the current format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable and online (Web) document publishing is diminished to zero. These are merely two dynamic manifestations of the same publication: content authored with online use as the primary mode can easily be saved by the user for offline reading in portable document form. Content authored primarily for use as a portable document can be put online, without any need for refactoring the content. Publishers can choose to utilize either or both of these publishing modes, and users can choose either or both of these consumption modes. Essential features flow seamlessly between online and offline modes; examples include cross-references, user annotations, access to online databases, as well as licensing and rights management.</p>

                <p>A more precise technical definition of <a>Web Publications</a> is provided in the section <a href='#pwp_definition'></a>. For the sake of this introduction, it suffices to say that a <a>Web Publication</a> is a collection of resources (e.g. pages, chapters, modules, articles) whose content is compatible with Web usage, and structured as a single, self-contained logical unit. Individual items can consist of text, images, graphics, possibly interactive mathematical or chemical formulae, as well as audio and video. These documents, by definition, have a default, linear โreading orderโ, however the user may choose to skip around in the content just as with a book on paper; alternatively, interactive aspects of the content may alter the reading order on behalf of the user.</p>

                <p>As mentioned already, a companion document&nbsp;[[pwp-ucr]] collects a set of more detailed use cases and requirements for <a>Web Publications</a>. The present document concentrates on the technical challenges to achieve this vision, and provides some technical directions aiming to address some of those challenges. None of the technical solutions should be considered final; a more detailed and rigorous specification should be done by a separate, dedicated Working Group.</p>

            <h3>Why Work on This Now?</h3>

            <p>Digital Publishing can be considered to be at a tipping point. Digital publishing formats like EPUB have been broadly adopted globally for trade ebooks, and are starting to gain adoption among textbook publishers as well as corporate marketing departments. However, these formats have largely been seen as โofflineโ formats up until now. Various browser extensions supporting such complex publications exist, and other solutions are available for delivering these publications in browsers. Browser- and cloud-based solutions require relatively complex server and/or client software. In many cases browser- and cloud-based solutions depend on a proprietary transformation of the packaged files into formats more suitable to network delivery. A focused effort to make digital publications first-class Open Web Platform citizens will result in a significant reduction in the complexity of deploying publishing content into browsers for both online and offline consumption. Further, this focused effort will increase the momentum of digital publication and associated Web adoption across communities who are looking for an open, non-proprietary, next-generation portable document format.</p>

            <p>A convergence between Digital Publications and the Web in general is also beneficial for โtraditionalโ Web content; many of the use cases described in&nbsp;[[pwp-ucr]] (e.g., usage of pagination for long form publications, the fact of considering a collection of resources as a single unit, etc.) are relevant for highly informative, albeit possibly less interactive Web content as well. The experience in ergonomy, production workflow, editorial craftmanship, etc., that the (Digital) Publishing industry has developed over the centuries may also have a positive influence on the evolution of Web content at large. Technically, in many respect, the development of Packaged Web Publications is in line with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">Progressive Web Apps</a> coming to the fore, insofar as breaking the boundaries between Web sites and Mobile Applications, an emphasis on โofflineโ paradigms, etc. (It is also worth noting that the technical approach explored in this document rely on the same technologies.)</p>

            <p>In many respects, the convergence is already happening. In a number of areas (e.g., educational publications, travel books, etc.) publishers already exploit the advanced possibilities of packaged publishing formats to produce highly interactive documents whose features are very close to what one is used to on the Web (see the separate section <a href="#epub-relations"></a> for some examples). And the converse is also true: tutorial and introductory articles have appeared on the Web that have the quality of traditional publications that one was used to seeing in a scientific magazine, but combined with the interactive possibilities of the Web (<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike Bostockโs article on visualizing algorithms</a> or <a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Bret Victorโs article on visualization</a> are just two of several possible examples). โTraditionalโ publications (for example in scholarly publishing) are increasingly moving on-line, exploring new possibilities and publishing paradigms, but also facing issues in combining their traditional requirements with the reality of the Web today. All in all, the convergence still has a long way to go, and this is the topic that this document, and the concept of <a>Packaged Web Publications</a>, aim to explore.</p>

            <h3>Terminology</h3>
            <p>This document is based on the following definitions.</p>
            <aside class="annotation">
                We may have to provide a definition for "Locator", possibly "Canonical Locator"
            </aside>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li>This document uses the term <dfn>user agent</dfn>, as used by the Web community; see, for example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent">WAI glossary entry</a>. The publishing community often uses the term โreading systemโ for roughly the same notion; while there may be subtle differences, it is better to stick to a single term for the purposes of this document.</li>

                <li>A <dfn>Web Publication</dfn> (WP) is a collection of one or more constituent resources, organized together in a uniquely identifiable grouping, and presented using standard Open Web Platform technologies.</li>

                <li>A <dfn data-lt="Packaged Web Publications">Packaged Web Publication</dfn> (PWP) is a <a>Web Publication</a> whose constituent resources are combined into a single distributable file, using some standard packaging format.</li>

                <li>In this document, <dfn>manifest</dfn> refers to an abstract means to contain information necessary to the proper management, rendering, and so on, of a publication. This is opposed to metadata that contains information on the content of the publication like author, publication date, and so on.

        <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>

        <p>This section considers some of the technical work areas that should be clarified for a more precise and detailed specification of <a>Web Publications</a>. The list is not exhaustive and there are only hints at the technical solutions without claiming to be complete and tested for validity. It must also be emphasized that some of solutions to the problems listed below may not come from W3C, but possibly from other, external organizations (document identification is a typical example).</p>

        <p>The <a href="#terminology"></a> section provides some conceptual framework for the technical discussion. The most important definition is the one of <a>Web Publications</a>: the fact that a WP, i.e., a single Web Resource, identifies a <em>collection</em> of <a data-lt="Web Resource">Web Resources</a> that conveys the โboundednessโ which characterizes a publication (e.g. a book or an article). All technical issues in this section are, fundamentally, around the question on how this boundedness should co-exist with the opennes of the Web in general.</p>

            <h3>Web Publications</h3>

            <section>
                <h2>Online/Offline</h2>

                <p>When handling Web Publications, a <a>user agent</a> has to achieve several tasks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Provide some sort of a local storage, or cache, of the WP content. To achieve this, the agent has to catch the HTTP(S) requests stemming from the rendering engine and has to, possibly, serve the content from its cache or the file. In other words, the <a>user agent</a> has to act as a network proxy.</li>

                    <li>Take care of the conversion of <a data-lt="locator">locators</a> to the consituent resources of a WP, possibly convert from locators provided via <a>state locators</a> or a <a>state independent locator</a>: the differences among these different locators should become transparent to the <a>rendering engine</a>.
                </ul>

                <figure style="text-align: center;" id="workers_basic">

                <p id="sworkers">The latest evolution of browser technologies around Web Workers&nbsp;[[web-workers]] and Service Workers&nbsp;[[service-workers]] make the development of such a <a>user agent</a> feasible. Service Workers provide a flexible and programmable way to efficiently implement local caching of <a data-lt="Web Resource">Web Resources</a>. Caching is implemented as a programmable network proxy, meaning that the browserโs rendering engine becomes oblivious to whether a resource originates from the local cache or directly from the network: these are indeed some of the basic functionalities a <a>user agent</a> must provide to handle Web Publications.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="identification">
                <h3>Addressing and Identification</h3>

                <p>HTTP(S) URLs serve as the fundamental method for addressing a resource, or a fragment thereof, on the Web. Such URLs can also be used to uniquely identify a resource; however, conceptually, <em class="extra-em">the role of addressing and identification are different</em>. <em>Both</em> of these functionalities should be available for <a>Web Publications</a>: a publication should be uniquely identified for, e.g., library catalogues or archival, and a resource locator should be available so that the user could access the content. In other words, a <a>Web Publication</a> SHOULD have both one or even possibly several <em>identifier(s)</em> and one <em>locator</em>. These may be be identical but may also be different: e.g., an identifier may refer to a specific publication by a publisher (e.g., using an <a href="https://www.isbn-international.org/">ISBN</a>), whereas the locator may refer to a personal copy of that publication that the owner can freely annotate for personal use.</p>

                <p class="note">A typical use case for the presence of an <em>identifier</em> beyond the need for a <em>locator</em> is in academic and scholarly publishing. There are currently several methods for citing online works, but there is no equivalent standard method for citations to ebooks. Even if a reflowable ebook is cited by a scholar, the author must refer to the PDF, paper copy, or HTML version to cite it in her bibliography. Identifiers attached to <a>Web Publications</a> should enable stable citations.</p>

                <p>A general [[URI]] (which includes the notion of [[URL]]) MAY serve as an <em>identifier</em> using, e.g., the [[ISBN-URN]] or [[UUID]] schemes. But an identifier does not necessarily resolve to a location on the Web, although it is a good practice to have a dereferencable identifier.</p>

                <p> There is no  ubiquitously accepted method for identifying a publication among the various document formats (whether electronic or printed). Within the scholarly publishing industry, for example, initiatives such as <a href="http://www.doi.org">DOI</a> and <a href="http://crossref.org">CROSSREF</a> have addressed this problem, whereas traditional โtradeโ publishing rely more on <a href="https://www.isbn-international.org/">ISBN</a> related services. Some of these identifier schemes provide resolver services or a โstandardโ representation in term of [[URL]]. <em>The definition of <a>Web Publication</a> should be oblivious to the exact identification used; this issue is left to specialized services and industry organizations.</em> Architecturally, the only requirement, regarding identifiers, is that the <a>complete manifest</a> of a  <a>Web Publication</a> MUST include a <a>manifest item</a> for one, or more, identifiers, and that these should be stable across, for example, copying the publication or changing its location on the Web. This document concentrates on addressing only, i.e., on the management of <a data-lt="locator">locators</a>.</p>

                <div class="issue" data-number="12">Do we need a more general form of identification to represent fragments?</div>

                <div class="issue"><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpub-pwp-loc/issues/28">Issue 28 on Locators</a>: do we need several, possibly a hierarchy of identifiers? The current discussion converges towards a model whereby a PWP may have
                    <ol>
                        <li>A set of identifiers (with possibly a label assigned to each identifier to describe what it is for and who is the authority to assign them)</li>
                        <li>A state independent locator (can we call this a 'state independent locator'?)</li>
                        <li>State specific locators of a particular copy (ie, a locator to my copy in zip, and a separate locator to the unpacked version on my server)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p> The rule being that the entries in (1) SHOULD be changed only by the respective authorities, and they MUST be part of the PWP manifest. </p>

            </section>

            <section id="manifest-details">
                <h3>WP Manifests</h3>
                <p>The <a>manifest</a> of <a>Web Publications</a> is a <a>Web Resource</a> that includes information pertaining to the overall publication structure, such as the default logical reading order(s) of the set of resources that comprise the publication (the โspineโ), as well as predictable user-facing meta-structures, such as one or several tables of contents, glossaries, etc. The <a>WP manifest</a> may also include various metadata (either directly or via further references) that are essential for the overall publishing workflow. The exact definition of all possible manifest items, the internal structure and serialization syntax of a <a>manifest</a>, etc., will require additional work as part of a more detailed specification of <a>Web Publications</a>.</p>

                <p>A fundamental question that must be answered is how does a <a>user agent</a> get hold of the manifest. Because the publication patterns of WPs can be different depending on publishers, authors, etc., there should be different ways of accessing the manifests: it can be referred to via a <code>link</code> element in an HTML file, can be in an agreed-upon-position within a package, or can be conveyed through a <code>LINK</code> header of an <code>HTTP(S)</code> request. The user agent gets hold of the <a>manifest</a> by following a hierarchy of these different possibilities; a separate <a href="#simple-manifest-access">section</a> in the appendix provides more details. (Note that accessing a manifest also has some security issues; the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/manifest/#obtaining">โObtaining a manifestโ</a> of the โWeb App Manifestโ&nbsp;[[web-manifest]] document provides some further details that could be adopted, too.)</p>

                <p> This algorithm is typically performed by the <a>user agent</a> when initialized with the state independent locator of a particular <a>WP</a> instance.</p>

                <p>The โWeb App Manifestโ&nbsp;[[web-manifest]], currently developed at W3C, is one example of a technology that could be used, or adopted, to define the final formats for PWP manifests. Although the current&nbsp;[[web-manifest]] drafts is geared towards Web Applications, it also includes extension points to define further manifest items necessary for PWP. Some of these extra manifest items have been already explored within the framework of the <a href="https://github.com/dauwhe/epub31-bff">โBrowser Friendly Manifestationโ</a> work of the EPUB3.1 Working Group at the IDPF. </p>
            </section>

            <section id="metadata">
                <h3>Metadata Discovery</h3>
                <p>Throughout the digital publishing industry, highly specialized metadata vocabularies, and serialization forms thereof, are being used. Within book trade publishing as an example, ONIX&nbsp;[[ONIX]] has attained a dominant status as a metadata package that typically exists (in XML form) independently of the publication, and contains not only bibliographic metadata, but also trade information such as pricing. Scholarly publishing, on the other hand, often uses various derivatives of the ubiquitous BibTeX vocabulary.</p>

                <p>While not contradicting the obvious use cases for out-of-line metadata records as used by publishers, retailers and libraries, <a>Web Publications</a> must define a syntax for basic in-line metadata records that is agnostic to the publicationโs states. This means that the syntax must seamlessly support discovery and harvesting by both generic Web search engines, as well as dedicated bibliographic/archival/retailer systems. While it is expected that <a>Web Publications</a> will define a minimal set of required metadata (cf. the section <a href="#identification"></a>), development and adoption of other vocabularies in <a>Web Publications</a> will most likely be deemed as out of scope. In other words, domain-specific metadata requirements are up to the domains themselves to define via a profiling mechanism, or similar yet-to-be-defined means. </p>

                <p class="note">The adoption of HTML as the vehicle for expressing publication-level metadata (i.e., using RDFa&nbsp;[[html-rdfa]] and/or Microdata&nbsp;[[microdata]] for metadata, like authors or title) would have the added benefits of better I18N support than XML or JSON formats.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Web Publication APIs</h2>
                <p>Access to the specific features of Web Publications via programming API is an important feature when it comes to Web Applicaitons making use of Web Publications. </p>

                <p class="note">These APIs would have to be specified through a separate incubation phase. Indeed, their specification requires a different expertise than most of what is described in this document, and for the most part there is no prior art.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Document Collection Interface and API</h2>
                    <p>At the moment, Web Resources used in a Web Publication (e.g., HTML or SVG) can be accessed, programatically, via the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#document">Document</a> interface, that provides attributes and methods to access the full tree-like structure of, say, the HTML content, the various attributes on each level, or the textual content. Programs make use of these possibilities, as well as related interfaces, to implement a multitude of operations on a single document.</p>

                    <p>However, a <a>Web Publication</a> is a <em>collection</em> of documents; consequently, a number of operations are to be performed on that collection as a whole. Typical examples are: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>full text search over the full Web Publication;</li>
                        <li>ensure a continuous section, list, table, etc., numbering when the corresponding Web Resources are read continuously, i.e., as part of the Web Publication;</li>
                        <li>provide an outlining and/or table of content generation over the Web Publication</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Although these operations may be performed via the current standard interfaces, but any such program would have to construct and manage a collection of such document interfaces. It would therefore improve interoperability to define such a Document Collection Interface, together with a set of suitable attributes and methods. </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Publication Object Model and API</h2>
                    <p>Many programmatic steps on Web Publications rely on the interplay of the individual resources and information stored elsewhere, for example in the <a href="#manifest-details">manifest</a> of the Web Publication. These include the creation of the Document Collection Interface object for the Web Publication itself, access to the various metadata items to display, e.g., the titles and other information to the reader, providing information on the publicationโs semantic sructure (that may go beyond the structure of the HTML elements in the resources), etc. Furthermore, these information may have to be changed by, e.g., a dynamic editor of a Web Publication.</p>

                    <p>These operations may be performed individually by, e.g., retrieving the information from the manifest or parsing the metadata that can make use of different syntaxes, it would improve the interoperability of implementations to define a standard Model and API that would represent a Web Publication in all its complexity. </p>

                    <p class="note">There is, currently, a separate <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/pom/">W3C Community Group on Publication Object Models</a>. At this moment no report has yet been published, though.</p>

                <h3>Styling and Layout, Pagination</h3>
                <p>As outlined in [[dpub-latinreq]] or [[dpub-css-priorities]], the Open Web Platform in general, and CSS in particular, is still lacking solutions for meeting all of the publishersโ expectations on satisfactory typography and layout for digital publications. While improved presentation fidelity will be of paramount importance to the overall success and adoption rate of <a>Web Publications</a>, it is clear that many of these issues are going to be addressed on a case-by-case basis by the CSS Working Group over a longer period of time. STM publishing, for example, where the faithful representation and rendering of, say, mathematical or chemical formulae is of a paramount importance, has particularly severe requirements that must be fulfilled by the Open Web Platform technologies. Similarly, dynamic pagination of reflowable content is not natively supported by browsers today, and as a result Reading System developers, for example, are forced to implement pagination using various ad-hoc approaches, all coming with a significant penalty in terms of development costs, performance and stability.</p>

                <p>It is anticipated that native support for pagination (in CSS and/or in the DOM) is going to be put forward by stakeholders as a critical component of <a>Web Publications</a>; thus the finalization of <a>Web Publications</a> may be contingent on the availability of a native pagination model for Web content.</p>

                <p class="note">Note that the <a href="https://wiki.css-houdini.org/">โHoudiniโ Task Force</a>, recently started jointly by the W3C CSS WG and the W3C TAG, may open new avenues to handle pagination.</p>

                <h3>Presentation Control and Personalization</h3>

                <p>When reading long-form (and sometimes mission-critical) publications, personalizationโi.e., the ability for users to adapt the presentation to suit their needsโis of a great importance. While technologies such as CSS Media Queries have come a long way in terms of adapting content to devices, this is not the same thing as adapting to a user. Presentation control features are often available in e-book readers of different kinds, for example the possibility to dynamically change font size or background/foreground color schemes, but implementations are brittle and limited due to the lack of an underlying framework that explicitly supports user adaptation.</p>

                <p><a>Web Publications</a> needs to incorporate an explicit framework for achieving advanced and predictable user-triggered presentation control. (Note that from this perspective, accessibility can be seen just a radical case of personalization.)</p>

            <h3>Packaged Web Publications</h3>
            <section id="package">
                <h4>Archive Formats</h4>

                <p>Regardless of the details of the practical architecture realizing <a>Web Publications</a>, an archive format is necessary for the storage of a publication as one file (e.g., for distribution or possibly archiving) defined as the <a>packed</a> state of a <a>Packaged Web Publication</a>. A variety of formats for offline/archival storage of collections of digital resources exist today (e.g., [[OCF]], [[ODF]], and [[OOXML]]), but none of them is universally recognized and supported across all ecosystems. Depending on the general architecture, <a>Packaged Web Publications</a> may use one of the deployed formats (e.g., the current EPUB packaging format based on [[OCF]]), or an archive format that is generic and native to the Open Web Platform. </p>

                <p>W3Cโs <a href="http://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft for a Streamable Package Format for the Web&nbsp;[[web-packaging]] to encompass the needs of various applications (like installing Web Applications or downloading data for local processing). It is not clear at this moment whether browsers will adopt this format, though. </p>

                <p>However, the importance of streaming is not paramount for <a>Packaged Web Publications</a>. Indeed, the same publication may be accessed by the same user from different clients; if some user-dependent management also keeps track of the latest reading position in the publication, switching from one client to the other may mean that a client would have to โjumpโ <em>into</em> the content, thereby bypassing streaming. Nevertheless, if browsers, eventually, do converge towards a browser and streaming friendly packaging format, adopting it for <a>Packaged Web Publications</a> may become a real alternative. The community will have to balance native browser availability against the the wide availibility of tooling and industry distribution based on [[OCF]].</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <p>The IETF has published an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-seantek-kerwin-arcmedia-type-01">informational draft on a top-level media type for archives</a>. Although that draft does not specify a specific archive format, and the work is currently on hold, it shows the overall interest in packaging on the Web in line with the concerns of <a>Packaged Web Publications</a>.</p>

                <h2>Canonical Locators Mapping in user agents</h2>

                <p>A <a>PWP</a> is published on the <a>server</a>. This <a>PWP</a> includes, e.g., the resource for an image, and is published in at least one of the different states:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Simply on the Web. The โtop levelโ of this state is available, say, through the URL <code>https://example.org/books/1/</code>: in this setup, the URL of the image is, say, <code>https://example.org/books/1/img/mona_lisa.jpg</code>. This is the <a>absolute locator</a> of the image <em>in this state</em>. </li>

                    <li>In a package. This is available through the URL, say, <code>https://example.org/packed-books/1/package.zip</code>. This is the <a>absolute locator</a> of the <a>PWP</a> <em>in this state</em>, and the locator for the image depends on the structure of the package format.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The published <a>PWP</a> is also assigned a <a>state independent locator</a>, e.g., the URL <code>https://example.org/published-books/1</code>. Reflecting the unpacked state in terms of (file) structure the <a>state independent locator</a> of the same image is <code>https://example.org/published-books/1/img/mona_lisa.jpg</code>. </p>

                <p>To ensure the smooth transtion among states the <a>user agent</a> must ensure a smooth transition among the different locators of any resource within a <a>PWP</a> (the image file in this example). </p>

                <p class="note">From a user/author point of view, whenever possible, the <a>state independent locator</a> should be used when referring to the <a>PWP</a> in, e.g., annotations. This is also true for URL-s derived from the <a>state independent locator</a>, like <code>https://example.org/published-books/1/img/mona_lisa.jpg</code>. This means the addressing unequivocal; however, a <a>user agent</a> must be prepared for the more general case. </p>

                <p>In view of the above, the functionalities of the <a>user agent</a> can be divided into two steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>finding, based on the <a>state independent locator</a>, the right values of the various <a>state locators</a></li>
                    <li>extract, based on a specific <a>state locator</a>, the exact locators for additional, internal resources</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This functionality is based on the requirement that the <a>complete manifest</a> of a PWP MUST include both the <a>state independent locator</a> as well as all available <a>state locators</a>. Consequently, in order to retrieve the <a>state locators</a>, the PWP must first retrieve the <a>PWP manifest</a> using the <a data-lt="state independent locator">state independent locator</a>. (See the separate section <a href="#manifest-details"></a> on the details of the <a>complete manifest</a> retrieval.) Once the <a>complete manifest</a> is available a resource within a PWP can be retrieved by first deriving the <a>relative locator</a> for a resource (e.g., <code>img/mona_lisa.jpg</code>) and then combining it with the <a>absolute locator</a> corresponding to the <a>state</a> of the PWP as referred to by the <a>rendering engine</a>.</p>

                <p class="note">There may be โsmarterโ <a data-lt="user agent">user agents</a> that make use of local facilities like caching, but those do not modify these conceptual approaches.

                <p>The security model of the Web, based primarily on the same-origin policy and the concept of โsiteโ, does not apply to portable documents, as the notion of โoriginโ is based on HTTP properties that are invalidated/non-existent when a document transitions from its online state to the portable state. (Packaged) Web Publications must incorporate a state agnostic security model that defines rules for both the online and portable states.</p>

        <h2>Profiling Web Publications</h2>

        <p>Web Publications, by design, must be able to accommodate publications of all sorts, from all domains, and to utilize all available web technologies.</p>

	    <p>However, in order to address the needs of their constituents and to streamline the authoring and interchange of publications in their ecosystems, certain domains or communities of interest may benefit from limiting the options that could be available or requiring certain features that would necessarily be optional for Web Publications in general. These would result in profiles of Web Publications that would in all respects be valid Web Publications: Web Publications done in a certain way to achieve those benefits.</p>

	    <p>For example, the current publication supply chain based on EPUB benefits from requirements such as a certain packaging format, navigation features, and metadata that presumably would be a subset of the options available to Web Publications in general; it may be desirable for what is currently an EPUB to become a particular type (and thus a profile) of Packaged Web Publication. Likewise, there could be a profile optimized for education that would require certain features for accessibility and to optimize interoperability with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) or Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), or a profile for scientific publications requiring citations to be in a particular form and optimized for the publication of data.</p>

	    <p>Such profiles may need to be able to be recursive, in the way that the current <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/profiles/edu/spec/">EPUB for Education</a> specification (commonly known as EDUPUB) is a profile of EPUB.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>This document outlines a vision for the convergence between the Open Web Platform and portable documents while also significantly advancing and expanding the existing digital publishing ecosystem. The realization of this vision would require a strong cooperation between the traditional publishing and Web communities, based on a close collaboration between the W3C and other relevant organizations, like <a href="http://idpf.org">IDPF</a>, <a href="http://editeur.org/">EDItEUR</a>, <a href="http://www.bisg.org">BISG</a>, or others. While it is envisaged that most of the work could be done in one or more dedicated Working Groups (within W3C or elsewhere, depending on the exact charter), it must be emphasized that many of the features will affect and will be affected by work done elsewhere, within or outside these organizations. The starting point will be to explore and plan for the detailed technical challenges to gain a better insight into the work ahead; this exploration should be done together with the various interested communities.</p>

        <h2>Algorithm to Retrieve the Manifest for a PWP</h2>

        <aside class="annotation">
            This section may have to be revised thoroughly. Indeed
            <ul>
                <li>There is a major push back on accessing a manifest file (e.g., a JSON file) directly, meaning that the appropriate branch may have to go</li>
                <li>If the publication manifest is on top of a Web App Manifest, then this algorithm should actually be removed and rely on whatever that specification provides. </li>
            </ul>
        </aside>

        <p>The goal of this algorithm is to obtain the <a>PWP manifest</a> based on the value of the <a>state independent locator</a> <strong>L</strong>. This algorithm is performed by the <a>user agent</a>, typically when it is initialized with the state independent locator <strong>L</strong> of a particular <a>PWP</a> instance. The algorithm retrieves the <a>PWP manifest</a> based on the HTTP(S) responses on a <code>HTTP GET</code> request on <strong>L</strong>.</p>

        <p class="note">
            If the <a>user agent</a> already has the cached publication, than that will probably prevail (modulo cache state) and there may be no HTTP request in the first place. This section really refers to the situation of a first access.
        </p>

        <p>In what follows, as an abuse of notation, <code>HTTP&nbsp;GET&nbsp;U</code>, for a URL <code>U</code>, refers to an <code>HTTP</code> or <code>HTTPS</code> request issued to the domain part of <code>U</code>, using the path from <code>U</code>. I.e., if <code>U</code> is <code>http://www.ex.org/a/b/c</code>, then <code>HTTP&nbsp;GET&nbsp;U</code> stands for:</p>

        <pre><code>GET /a/b/c HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ex.org</code></pre>

        <p>See [[rfc2616]] for further details.</p>

        <p>With these prerequisites, the algorithm is as follows (see also <a href="#fig-flow-get-1">the figure</a> as a visual aid to the algorithm). The input to the algorithm is the <a>state independent locator</a> of the <a>PWP</a> instance, <strong>L</strong>.</p>

        <ol class="algorithm" id="simple_algorithm">
            <li>Issue an <code>HTTP&nbsp;GET&nbsp;L</code> request, possibly returning the message body <strong>B</strong>.</li>

            <li>If the response is not successful (e.g., the response code is a 404), the process fails with no results.</li>

            <li>Otherwise, consider the HTTP Response headers:
                <ol>
                    <li>If the headers include an entry of the form  <code>LINK&nbsp;&lt;URI&gt;;&nbsp;rel="manifest"</code> (see [[rfc5988]]) then issue an <code>HTTP&nbsp;GET&nbsp;URI</code> request. </li>

                    <li>If that response is successful, the algorithm stops by returning the response message body to the caller as the <a>PWP manifest</a>.</li>

                    <li>(Otherwise, the algorithm continues.)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Consider the media type of the original message body <strong>B</strong>. If it is:
                <ol>
                    <li>A <em>manifest</em>, as identified by its media type (to be defined), the algorithm stops by returning the response content <strong>B</strong> to the caller as the <a>PWP manifest</a>.</li>

                    <li>A <em>packaged PWP instance</em> (identified via the media type to be specified for the packed <a>state</a> of a PWP):
                        <ol>
                            <li>Unpack the package, and retrieve the <a>manifest</a> embedded in the package as (to be) specified by the packed state of a PWP.</li>
                            <li>The algorithm stops by returning the manifest retrieved from the package to the caller as the <a>PWP manifest</a></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>An <em>HTML document</em>, then
                        <ol>
                            <li>If the HTML content includes a <a>manifest</a> content embedded in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element, serialized in to one of the accepted serializations for PWP manifests:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Retrieve and parse the content of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element.</li>
                                    <li>If parsing is successful, the algorithm stops by returning the parsed manifest content to the caller as the <a>PWP manifest</a>.</li>
                                    <li>Otherwise, the algorithm continues</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>If the HTML content includes a <code>&lt;link&nbsp;rel="manifest"&nbsp;href="URI"&gt;</code> in the header:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Issue a <code>HTTP&nbsp;GET&nbsp;URI</code> request</li>
                                    <li>If the response is successful, the algorithm stops by returning the response message body to the caller as the <a>PWP manifest</a>.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If the algorithm gets to this points, it fails with no results.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note" id="man_alg_notes">
            <li>The algorithm considers only HTML as a possible non-packaged and non-manifest response format. It may become possible to allow, for example, SVG as another, possible format for a <a>PWP</a>; this depends on the final specification of a PWP. The algorithm should then be adapted accordingly by adding a relevant branch (e.g., the specification of SVG includes <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element that can be used to embed a manifest, but does not have a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element).</li>

            <li>It may be possible for HTML file to includes several <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements referring to a <a>manifest</a> each. If that becomes allowed by a PWP specification, the corresponding step could be modified by taking all link elements into account, and sequentially considering the manifest files in document order to yield the manifest. The same note is valid for several <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements.</li>

            <li>Similarly, if a PWP specification allows for several different serialization syntaxes for manifests, the user agent should be able to recognize and parse them accordingly. The expectation is that the various possible serializations MUST serialize the <em>same</em> content, i.e., these do not influence the final result.</li>

            <li>The algorithm is silent on the details on how a manifest should be retrieved from a package. This depends on the detailed specification of packaging, on whether a manifest would have to be at a known location within a package, on whether there might be several manifest instances within a package, etc. It is also possible that the details would follow a similar approach as described in this algorithm, i.e., relying on embedded and linked manifests of a top level HTML file, for example. As far as the algorithm described in this section is concerned, these details do not influence the final result.</li>

            <li>The algorithm makes use of the constant <code>manifest</code>; Which is also used by the Web App Manifest to indicate the relationship between a resource and its manifest.</li>

            <li>The user agent MAY include an <code>Accept</code> header (see [[rfc7231]]) when issuing a <code>HTTP GET</code> to express its preference for, e.g., a packed state of a PWP over manifest payload, or in favor of a particular serialization of the manifest content. Whether this is done or not, and whether the server honors this preference, does not influence the details of the algorithm.</li>
